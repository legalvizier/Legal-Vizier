This could include compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other losses resulting from the altercation.</div>
            <div class="bu">Self-Defense: If you were defending yourself or others during the altercation, be prepared to provide evidence supporting your claim of self-defense. This could include witness statements, physical evidence, and testimony from experts.</div>
            <div class="bu">Follow Legal Process: Cooperate with law enforcement, legal authorities, and any court proceedings related to the altercation. Adhering to the legal process ensures that your rights are protected and that justice is served.</div>
