                    Hang Up: The first step is to simply hang up the phone. Do not engage with the caller or provide
                    them with any personal information.

                <div class="bu">
                    Report the Call: You can report scam calls to the appropriate authorities. In the United States, you
                    can report them to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at ftc.gov/complaint. In other countries,
                    check with your local consumer protection agency or telecommunications regulator.

                <div class="bu">
                    Block the Number: If possible, block the number from which the scam call originated. This can help
                    prevent further attempts from the same caller.
                </div>
                <div class="bu">
                    Contact Your Phone Service Provider: Inform your phone service provider about the scam call. They
                    may have resources or services to help block or filter scam calls in the future.
                </div>
                <div class="bu">
                    Consider Legal Action: If you believe you have been a victim of fraud or if the scam call has
                    resulted in financial loss, you may consider seeking legal advice. Contact a lawyer who specializes
                    in consumer protection or fraud cases to discuss your options.
                </div>
                <div class="bu">
                    Educate Yourself: Stay informed about common scam tactics and learn how to recognize them. Websites
                    like the FTC's consumer information page offer resources and tips for identifying and avoiding
                    scams.

                <div class="bu">
                    Protect Your Personal Information: Be cautious about sharing personal information, especially over
                    the phone. Legitimate organizations typically won't ask for sensitive information like your Social
                    Security number or banking details over the phone.
